A simulation with no thermostat
-------------------------------

So far, simulations were made using the NVT ensemble [constant number 
of atoms, N, constant volume V, and constant (or at least imposed)
temperature T].

Run a similar simulation in the NVE ensemble, and extract the
total energy of the system over time.

Make sure that the total energy is conserved over time, as see here. Note also 
that the kinetic energy constantly exchanges with the potential energy.
