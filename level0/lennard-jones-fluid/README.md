# Lennard Jones fluid

## A simulation with no thermostat

1) It is important to first bring the system to a proper temperature by running a
small NVT simulation, which is done here with the [first input](./a-simulation-with-no-thermostat/input.a.lammps).

## Do without the ‘minimize’ command

## Non-equilibrium simulation

## Dumbbell molecules
