Here, the goal is to measure the osmotic pressure.

Equilibrium/ and SystemCreation/ folders have been explained in the main part of the tutorial. 

In Porosity0.5/, extra commands are used to freeze the position of one of the piston. Then, the average 
force applied by the fluid on the frozen piston is extracted, which allows one to extract the
osmotic pressure.
