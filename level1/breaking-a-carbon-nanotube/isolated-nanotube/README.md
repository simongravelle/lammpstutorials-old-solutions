Isolated nanotube
-----------------

When a rubber band is streched up, it heats up due to entropy change. 
In the current simulation, the constant exchange of energy between the CNT and 
thermostat prevents the temperature to evolve as the CNT is getting deformed.
Remove the thermostat and observe the evolution of the temperature of an
*isolated* carbon nanotube being deformed. Does it heat-up? Or does it cool down?
