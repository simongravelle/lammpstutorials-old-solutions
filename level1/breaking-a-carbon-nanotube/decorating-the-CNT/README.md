Decorate the CNT with hydrogens
-------------------------------

Add hydrogen atoms randomly to the system (using the same
AIREBO force field). Equilibrate the system. After some time, some hydrogen atoms will 
decorate the free carbon atoms at the edge of the CNT. Some 
other hydrogen atoms may bond together and form :math:`H_2` molecules.
