Generate a PEG-H2O mixture
--------------------------

Create a PEG-H2O mixture with several PEG molecules hydrated in a
cubic box.

Have a look at the LAMMPS *replicate* command.
Note tthat there is no obligation to equilibrate the water molecules separately from the PEG,
as we did here. You can also create the water molecules directly around the PEG molcule
using the *create_atom* command.
